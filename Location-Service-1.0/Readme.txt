 Use mvn package to build the project

 To run the application use the following command from within the Location-Service folder:
  java -jar target/Location-Service-1.0-SNAPSHOT.one-jar.jar

Read data from static file /reasource/location-data.json - this is only a temporary measure,
my prefered database in this case would have been a nosql database for a fast and scalable api.
